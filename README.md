# SEPRSO

Multi-agent RL research on SESiL, over **PettingZoo** and **OpenSpiel**, with
room for several methods (PSRO, PPO, GEMS, ...) compared under one budget and
one evaluation protocol. Developed for Linux (native, a remote server, or WSL).

Status:
- **`psro`** works. It follows OpenSpiel's `psro_v2` in structure and defaults
  (re-implemented on this codebase's env interface, so it also runs on
  PettingZoo), with psro_v2's three oracles: RL with policy gradient (`pg`),
  RL with DQN (`dqn`), and exact best response (`br`, OpenSpiel only).
- **`gems`** works: the Generative Evolutionary Meta-Solver (Sharma et al.,
  TMLR 2026), per-player form, with the paper's Kuhn-poker defaults. See below.
- `ppo` (self-play) is a registered placeholder that raises
  `NotImplementedError`.
- `random` is a pipeline check, not a method.

## Installation (Linux / WSL)

```bash
conda create -n seprso python=3.11 -y && conda activate seprso
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu    # or a CUDA build
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest -q
```

Without conda, `python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate` works the
same. OpenSpiel ships Linux and macOS wheels only, so on a Windows machine run
everything inside WSL.

## How to run

```bash
python main.py --method random --env kuhn_poker --budget 100000 --seed 0

# PSRO as in psro_v2_example.py, with its three oracles
python main.py --method psro --env kuhn_poker --psro-oracle br  --budget 100000000 --eval-metrics nash_conv
python main.py --method psro --env kuhn_poker --psro-oracle pg  --budget 100000000 --eval-metrics nash_conv
python main.py --method psro --env kuhn_poker --psro-oracle dqn --budget 100000000 --eval-metrics nash_conv

bash run.sh --method psro --env leduc_poker --budget 100000000 --seeds 0,1,2

# GEMS with the paper's defaults (40 iterations)
python main.py --method gems --env kuhn_poker --budget 100000000 --eval-metrics nash_conv
python main.py --method gems --env connect_four --budget 100000000
```

`--eval-metrics nash_conv` gives exact NashConv on OpenSpiel turn-based games
and on the native matrix games. PettingZoo games have no exact equivalent; use
`vs_random` / `self_play` there.

Output goes to `results/<exp-name>/<env>/<method>/seed<seed>/`:
`config.json`, `eval.jsonl` (one record per evaluation watermark, same schema
for every method) and `train.jsonl` (method internals: `psro_iteration` /
`oracle_episode` records, `gems_iteration` records with meta-strategies,
values, oracle picks and ABR losses).

Every eval record carries `method`, `env`, `seed`, `budget` and the method's
variant (PSRO: `oracle`, `meta_solver`, `pg_loss`; GEMS: `generator`), so arms
of one method never merge in a plot. A run directory that already holds logs is
refused; use another `--exp-name` per arm, or `--overwrite` to replace a run.

OpenSpiel games take parameters inline: `--env "openspiel:kuhn_poker(players=3)"`.

## Plotting

```bash
python plot_results.py results/main --list-metrics          # arms, seeds, metrics found
python plot_results.py results/main                         # nash_conv, else vs_random/mean
python plot_results.py results/main --metric vs_random/mean --metric self_play/mean --train
python plot_results.py results --filter env=space_invaders --band minmax --out fig.pdf
python plot_results.py results/main --table                 # the numbers instead of a figure
```

One series per arm (experiment, env, method and the method's variant fields
from the eval records); seeds are averaged with a std / min-max / IQR band on
the env-step axis, interpolated onto a shared grid where seeds' evaluation
points differ. Legend names show only what differs between the plotted arms.
`--train` adds `<out>_train.png`: PSRO's best-response training return and
GEMS's mixture value and chosen-candidate value per iteration and seat.
Default output: `<root>/plot.png`.

## Space Invaders (PettingZoo Atari)

```bash
pip install "pettingzoo[atari]" autorom
AutoROM            # accept the ROM licence
python main.py --method gems --env space_invaders --budget 100000000
```

The `space_invaders` preset is `pettingzoo.atari.space_invaders_v2` (Parallel
API, grey-scale) behind `AtariPreprocessing` (`seprso/envs/wrappers.py`):
4-frame skip with max-pooling of the last two frames, 84x84, 4-frame stack,
uint8 observations of shape `[4, 84, 84]`. One env step = one decision = 4
emulator frames, so `--budget` and `--max-episode-steps` count decisions. Two
players, 6 actions each, both scoring against the invaders (not zero-sum: use
PRD / GEMS's OMWU, not the Nash LP). No exact NashConv exists; evaluate with
`vs_random` / `self_play`.

Image observations go through a Nature-DQN CNN (`learners/networks.py`) in PG,
DQN and GEMS (for GEMS's `hyper` generator the CNN torso is shared and the
policy head is generated from z).

Measured cost (WSL, CPU, 8 threads): random play ~380 decisions and 0.6 s per
episode; CNN policies ~450-500 decisions and 1.1-1.2 s per episode; a PG
update ~0.25 s per episode. At the default settings that is ~6 h per PSRO-PG
iteration (20,000 training episodes) plus ~20 min per new payoff entry, and
~1 h per GEMS iteration (~40 h for its 40 iterations).

## PSRO and psro_v2

Defaults are `psro_v2_example.py`'s: PG oracle with QPG loss, a 4x256 ReLU MLP,
Adam, critic lr 1e-2, policy lr 1e-3, entropy cost 0.001, 8 critic updates per
policy update; 10,000 training episodes per response; 1000 simulations per
payoff entry; PRD with 50,000 iterations and gamma 1e-10; at most 100
iterations. The DQN oracle uses the example's 4x256 network, batch 32, lr 1e-2,
target update every 1000 steps and learning every 10.

Where this differs from psro_v2, on purpose:

| | psro_v2 | here | why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Learners | JAX (`open_spiel/python/jax`) | PyTorch ports, same algorithms | one framework for the codebase |
| Default meta-solver | `alpharank` | `auto` (Nash LP for 2-player zero-sum, else PRD) | alpharank not ported yet |
| Default oracle | `BR` | `pg` | BR exists only for OpenSpiel; `pg` runs everywhere |
| PG policy loss | softmax over all actions | illegal actions masked | untrained Q of illegal actions otherwise pulls probability to them |
| Stopping | iterations | iterations **or** env-step budget | the budget is the cross-method currency |

Not ported yet: alpharank, `rm` / `uniform_biased` meta-solvers, rectified
training, symmetric-game mode, `number_policies_selected > 1`.

**Checked against psro_v2.** Kuhn poker, PG oracle, PRD meta-solver, example
defaults otherwise, 10 iterations, NashConv after each iteration (OpenSpiel
2.0.2, its JAX learners):

| iteration | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| psro_v2_example | 0.586 | 0.395 | 0.374 | 0.364 | 0.335 | 0.343 | 0.331 | 0.323 | 0.324 | 0.317 |
| SEPRSO | 0.570 | 0.289 | 0.390 | 0.370 | 0.365 | 0.341 | 0.316 | 0.326 | 0.328 | 0.311 |

(The example's `nash` meta-solver could not be compared: its cvxpy LP returns
no solution on the initial 1x1 game with current cvxpy.)

## GEMS

`seprso/methods/gems.py`, after Algorithm 1 of the paper, in its per-player form
(App. F/H): every seat has its own generator, anchor set and meta-strategy.
Each iteration: (1) Monte-Carlo value of every anchor against the other seats'
mixtures, (2) one optimistic MWU step, (3) an EB-UCB bandit over mutated and
random latent codes adds one anchor, (4) ABR-TR fine-tunes the generator
(policy gradient with GAE plus a KL trust region). No payoff table is kept.

Defaults are the paper's Kuhn reference settings (App. Table 3): T=40, k0=1,
k_max=32, d_z=8, tau=1; N_MC=8 x M_MC=2; OMWU eta=0.03 const, logit cap 50;
N_oracle=8 x M_oracle=2, 32 mutated (std 0.2) + 32 random candidates, delta_0=0.5;
K_ABR=30 steps of 16 anchors, lr 2e-4, beta_KL=0.05, q_new=0.25, grad clip 0.5.

Where the paper is silent or ambiguous, the choice made here:

| | paper | here |
|---|---|---|
| Generator | "hypernetwork", "standard MLP" | MLP z -> weights of a 1-hidden-layer (64, tanh) policy (`--gems-generator hyper`); `conditional` = MLP([obs, z]) |
| Critic for GAE | not described | V(obs, z) MLP, lr 1e-3, gamma 0.99, lambda 0.95 |
| Reward scale | assumed in [0, 1] | normalised per seat: OpenSpiel min/max utility, matrix payoff range, else range seen in random play |
| Mixture value r_hat | B=128 joint samples | sigma . v_hat (same in expectation; a constant OMWU's normalisation removes) |
| New anchor's mass | not stated | 1/(k+1) (OMWU cannot grow a zero) |
| "Top anchors" to mutate | not defined | parents drawn proportionally to sigma |
| q_new = 0.25 | "new-opponent fraction" | probability a training anchor in ABR-TR is the new code (q_t of Eq. 11) |
| lambda_J (Jacobian) | not in Table 3 | 0 (implemented, off) |
| n > 2 players | importance-weighted shared batch | per-anchor estimates for every seat (also unbiased) |

**Kuhn poker, paper defaults, one seed** (NashConv; the paper reports
exploitability ~0.18 at iteration 40, which may be NashConv / 2):
0.895 at start, best 0.332, 0.484 after 40 iterations (exploitability 0.24),
347k env steps. Training anchor codes only on the new code (`--gems-new-fraction 1`)
ended at 0.388. On rock-paper-scissors GEMS drifts away from the uniform Nash it
starts near: ABR-TR pushes all anchors of the shared generator towards the same
best response faster than the KL term holds them.

## Design rules

- **One env interface.** Every step takes `{agent: action}`; every `TimeStep`
  says which agents act next (`acting`). Turn-based and simultaneous games are
  the same loop. Rewards are reported for *all* agents on every transition.
- **Budget = env steps.** Every training step a method takes is charged,
  including payoff-table simulation. Evaluation is not charged.
- **Same evaluation for everyone.** Methods expose `policies()` (one `Policy`
  per seat); the `Evaluator` scores it at the same watermarks with the same
  metrics, so `eval.jsonl` files from different methods line up.
- **Registries, not edits.** A new method is a file in `seprso/methods/` with
  `@METHODS.register('name')`, imported in `methods/__init__.py`, plus its
  argument group in `config.py`. A new metric is `@METRICS.register('name')`.
- **Environments by preset.** Add frequently used envs to `ENV_PRESETS`; try
  others ad hoc with `--env openspiel:<game>` or
  `--env pettingzoo:<module>[@parallel]`.
